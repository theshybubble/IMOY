                 In In Memory of You, we follow the main character’s journey <br>
                 though grief and depression, after losing two very special <br>
                 people in her life. By sharing Aurora’s story with the world, <br>
                 our main go was to show that things do get better, even if <br>
                 sometimes it feels like there’s no way out. <br>
                 <br>
                 However important it is to regard dearly the ones we lost, <br>
                 we must remember to appreciate the ones we still have <br>
                 in our lives. Do not take the people you love for granted and <br>
                 make memories with them whilst you still can.

                Mental health (or emotional health) is just as important <br>
                as one’s physical health. We all get sad, stressed, <br>
                and frightened. Most of the time these feelings come to pass, <br>
                but sometimes they develop into more serious issues. <br>
                <br>
                There is a stigma surrounding the topic and people <br>
                tend to get uncomfortable talking about it. That is why it is <br>
                important to spread awareness of its importance. <br>
                It is healthy to understand and talk about what you’re feeling. <br>
                <br>
                The most common mental health problems are depression and anxiety, <br>
                but there are many other issues that can affect someone. However, <br>
                the absence of a diagnosable mental health problem does not mean <br>
                someone has a good mental help. For this reason, do not hesitate <br>
                on getting help if something does not seem right. <br>
